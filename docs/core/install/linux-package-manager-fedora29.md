# <a name="fedora-29-package-manager---install-net-core"></a>Fedora 29 Package Manager - Install .NET Core

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-switcher](./includes/package-manager-switcher.md)]

This article describes how to use a package manager to install .NET Core on Fedora 29. If you're installing the runtime, we suggest you install the [ASP.NET Core runtime](#install-the-aspnet-core-runtime), as it includes both .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

Before installing .NET, you'll need to:

- Register the Microsoft key
- register the product repository
- Install required dependencies

This only needs to be done once per machine.

Open a terminal and run the following commands.

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
sudo wget -q -O /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft-prod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/29/prod.repo
```

Update the products available for installation, then install the .NET Core SDK. In your terminal, run the following command.

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-3.0
```
