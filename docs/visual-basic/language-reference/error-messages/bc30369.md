# <a name="cannot-refer-to-an-instance-member-of-a-class-from-within-a-shared-method-or-shared-member-initializer-without-an-explicit-instance-of-the-class"></a>V rámci sdílené metody nebo inicializační procedury sdíleného člena nelze odkazovat na instanci členu, aniž by byla k dispozici explicitní instance třídy.

You have tried to refer to a non-shared member of a class from within a shared procedure. The following example demonstrates such a situation:
  
```vb  
Class Sample
    Public x as Integer  
    Public Shared Sub SetX()
        x = 10  
    End Sub  
End Class  
```  
  
 In the preceding example, the assignment statement `x = 10` generates this error message. This is because a shared procedure is attempting to access an instance variable.  
  
 The variable `x` is an instance member because it is not declared as [Shared](../modifiers/shared.md). Each instance of class `Sample` contains its own individual variable `x`. When one instance sets or changes the value of `x`, it does not affect the value of `x` in any other instance.
  
 However, the procedure `SetX` is `Shared` among all instances of class `Sample`. This means it is not associated with any one instance of the class, but rather operates independently of individual instances. Because it has no connection with a particular instance, `setX` cannot access an instance variable. It must operate only on `Shared` variables. When `SetX` sets or changes the value of a shared variable, that new value is available to all instances of the class.

1. Decide whether you want the member to be shared among all instances of the class, or kept individual for each instance.

2. If you want a single copy of the member to be shared among all instances, add the `Shared` keyword to the member declaration. Retain the `Shared` keyword in the procedure declaration.

3. If you want each instance to have its own individual copy of the member, do not specify `Shared` for the member declaration. Remove the `Shared` keyword from the procedure declaration.
